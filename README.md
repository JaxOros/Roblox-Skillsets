# Roblox-Skillsets

This portfolio showcases individual tools, systems, and abilities I’ve developed for Roblox.  
Each project is modular and can be integrated into a variety of tool-based games or modules.

## Systems
- [Anti-Exploit Framework](Systems/AntiExploitFramework) – A modular system for detecting and preventing exploit behavior in games, including RemoteEvent validation, movement monitoring, and logging.
- [Stat Manager](Systems/StatManager) – A server-authoritative system for managing player stats, abilities, and progression.
- [Simple Teleporting Pad](Systems/TeleportingPad) - A simple pad that counts the players currently inside and logs them, the first to join gets a ui and based on remote events will teleport.

## Abilities
- [Simple Solemn Lament](Abilities/SolemnLament) – A simple M1-based tool with a built-in keycode detector for its special ability.
- [Lingering Snow](Abilities/LingeringSnow) – A skill that creates a slash barrage in front of the user, causing hit enemies to slow while affected.
- [Tachyon](Abilities/Tachyon) – A skill that creates floating math glyphs based on the user's movement speed.
- [Scuffed Raijin](Abilities/ScuffedRaijin) – A skill that allows teleportation between saved points.
