# Teleportation Tags - Roblox Skill System

**Teleportation Tags** is a custom skill for Roblox that allows players to place teleportation tags in the world and teleport to them. The system uses a combination of RemoteEvents, tag objects, and user input for flexible movement mechanics.

## Features

- **Tag Placement**
  - Left-click to place a teleportation tag on a nearby object.
  - Left-click near an existing tag removes it.
  - Tags automatically weld to objects to stay in place.

- **Teleportation**
  - Right-click to teleport to the nearest tag in the camera's direction.
  - Teleportation is limited to a short distance from the player.
  - Ensures safe movement by slightly offsetting the player's position above the tag.

- **Server-Client Communication**
  - Server handles the actual teleportation for validation and security.
  - Client handles tag placement, aiming, and input detection.

- **Visual Tags**
  - Tags are based on a template object (`Mark`) that can include any visual effects or indicators.
  - Supports multiple tags at once.

- Clean up tags by removing or destroying them manually when not needed to avoid clutter in the workspace.
